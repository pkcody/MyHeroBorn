Goal: Collect all three items to win the game and avoid enemies.

Assets used from Unity store:
- Free Monster Bat
- Polygonal Foliage Asset Package

Started with "Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity" by Harrison Ferrone for the base of the game. 
I made the particles, some basics assets, all the animations, different pickups, the pause screen, switching perspectives, and a hidden easter egg.
